## BSC FXS tokens
Many users have asked how they can withdraw $FXS from Binance to BSC and get natively issued (canonical/official) FXS onchain. If you withdraw FXS from Binance directly to BSC, you can use this handy swap UI to get the native $FXS token on BSC!

**Swap Ratio:** 1 to 1
<br />
**Binance FXS on BSC:** 0xDE2F075f6F14EB9D96755b24E416A53E736Ca363
<br />
**Canonical (official) FXS on BSC:** 0xe48A3d7d0Bc88d552f730B62c006bC925eadB9eE
<br />
**Rationale**: Fraxferry is now the official bridging solution for moving Frax-related tokens across chains. There are still a number of old bridge tokens that have not been converted to their official / canonical equivalents. The Binance FXS token (0xDE2...363) is one of them. We are working with Binance to gradually retire these to reduce confusion about users sending unsupported tokens to Binance Exchange and having them stranded.
